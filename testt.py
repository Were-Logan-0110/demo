print("""I don’t know what to say. I’m kind of having a mild freak out and I’m not sure what I’m supposed to think. Two days ago, I wrote a letter to somebody, so I grabbed a notebook from my nightstand. I know it was this notebook in particular because on the very first page there was a journal entry from when I had briefly attempted to write journals. I remember reading the journal entry and then turning to the next page and writing what I needed to. When I finished I skimmed through the rest of the notebook and found a few pages of comic strips I had drawn from years back I had almost forgotten about. I ripped the page out that I needed (I still have it and have already checked the back of it) and continued on. Today, I decided to tidy up my room and saw the notebook. First page still has the same journal entry. Except now, the pages with the comic strips have disappeared. I know I did not rip them out for any reason. I have looked through every single page of this notebook, front to back, and they are nowhere to be found. I have even checked other notebooks I have stashed away in my closet just in case and they are not there either.

It’s like they’ve just vanished. I feel like I’m losing my mind. I KNOW that I saw them in that specific notebook just a few days ago. Now they’ve just… disappeared."""
